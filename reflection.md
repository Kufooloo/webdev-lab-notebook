### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.
I was able to complete this lab on my won without the videos. I thought the exercises where very helpful, as they helped cement my understanding of basic html code. I'm not really sure how anything could have been done better as this was pretty basic.

### Accessibility

I completed this secition without any help. There was only one activity for this section, so it was the most helpful one. This was more of a a review as did the discussion first, but it was helpful to see what needed to be fixed and how to fix them. The only thing I wish was explained a little better is what the lab was. At least in my repo there are no instructions, so it took a second to see what I needed to do.

This activity was helpful as it helped me understand more about the accessibility requirements for pages.

### CSS

This lab was helpful, but I did need to look at the video to get some help with the position activity. This was the one I struggled the most with, but was also the one that helped the most. It was good to review selectors, as well as the different kinds of positions.

I don't think anything was particularly hard to understand, however I don't believe that the MD specified different sizes so I used the ones from our HWs.

I can't think of any specific examples that would help me better, though a little bit more about specifivity and how rules are overwritten would have been nice.

### Flexbox

This lab was a little annoying, but I didnt use any of the videos, just a page I found online that listed all the flex properties. This was a very helpful lab because flex solves a lot of issues I had with making things look nice on my webpages.

I'm not really sure if anything cold have been explained better, but I was struggling to get flex-container-6 to do anything until it suddenly just worked magically. I'm not sure why this is the case but it was a little frustrating. This lab was very much just implementing basic features for each of the 6 examples, so any more instructions would have been a little excessive, and may have just outlined the answers.

I'm not sure if I can name a specific exercise that would have made it easier, but a little more on some of the different properties would do nothing but help.

### CSS Grid

This lab was probably the worst one to do after I had already finished the homework. I didnt use any of the videos, however I did take a little peak at the solution. I forgot about repeat(n) which would have been a little helpful for column formatting but it wasn't a big deal.

This lab was really helpful in understanding how to do the homeowork, my big issue is I did it after the homework was due so that was a little diminishedsd.

I don't think anything needed to be explained better, @media queries are still a little rough for me but nothing too bad. I think overall some more media queries would be helpful but thats about it.
